        <h3>What is Deepin?</h3>
        <p>Deepin is a Linux distribution, based on Debian. It's unique, user-friendly, and very easy to use. You can download Deepin 2015 Alpha 2 from <a href="http://blog.deepin.org/2015/11/deepin-15-alpha2-a-different-deepin-for-you/">here</a>. Make sure you download the correct version for you (32-bit or 64-bit). If you don't have it already, you can download Oracle VM VirtualBox from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">here</a>. These steps work for both Windows and Linux operating systems.

        <h3>Setting up the virtual machine</h3>
        <img src="nameos.PNG" alt="Name the OS" class="wrap" align="left">
        <p>Once you have VirtualBox installed, we can step right into the installation of Deepin. Click on the <span>New</span> button in VirtualBox to begin. Write <span>Deepin</span> in the <span>Name</span> field, choose <span>Linux</span> from the <span>Type</span> drop-down list, and choose <span>Other Linux (32-bit or 64-bit)</span>. Next, choose the amount of RAM (notice that VirtualBox makes suggestions based on your computer's specifications), and then create a new virtual hard-disk. A new dialog box will open, where you'll set up the virtual hard-disk. You can choose it to be dynamically allocated (it grows in size when needed, up to a limit you set), although many prefer the <span>Fixed</span> size option, since it usually makes the virtual machine faster and does not fragment the host operating system. Pay attention that 8GB are required to install the system, so choose a size greater than that.
